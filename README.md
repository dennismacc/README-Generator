## Description
The purpose of this project was to provide a quick and easy way to create README.md files for users that includes all the elements of a professional README file such as title, description, table of contents, usage, licenses, contributing, etc. The application is built entirely with JavaScript and uses Node.js as a back end application and the Inquirer package within the command line to ask the user questions and then based on their answers dynamically create the README file. The application also saves the users information into a JSON file so that they can access the information and make any updates or changes to the README file.
This application helps streamline the development process and allows for the user to spend less time writing the README file and more time on other parts of the application. While this generator will automatically create the README file for the user, it will also allow them to go back and update their information and input any additional information manually. 
Creating this application allowed me to further my skills of working with back end applications such as Node.js as well as NPM packages, such as Inquirer, that was used to ask questions and return answers through the command line interface. 

## Usage
This application can be used opening the command line and answering the prompted questions within the terminal. After you answer all of the questions in the command line then your README file will be automatically created along with a JSON file that has all the data that was inputed by the user.
